<h2>About Arcra</h2>

 <p>Arcra is a personal distro of mine designed to provide the same functionality as the Nobara Project for users experienced with Arch and Arch-based distros, by providing much of the same packages for gamers and content creators, as well as a collection of tools to provide a stable experience.</p>

<p>For instance the Aura package manager, which can provide a list of installed packages as a json file, from which it can restore, in case some new package added affects things.</p>

<p>Also quality of life features, such as fractional scailing which is absent from Gnome by default.</p>

<p>Gnome is currently the only DE available right now, but XFCE and KDE are being worked on and will be included soon.</p>

<p>However I must stress the following: Ventoy and pi imager are both known working for flashing the boot iso, and work on multiple platforms. Any other flashing methods, particularly balena etcher are considered unsupported and may not recieve support.</p>

<p>Balena Etcher was the source of a number of late nights spent trying to resolve the issue, so if you use it, know that I will not help you.</p>

<p>My personal recommendation is to use Ventoy, as it is what I have been using during development of Arcra and will continue to use.</p>

<p>Also, I should mention that since my pc is of lower spec than others, you may want to recompile the tkg kernel to optimise it for your own pc, after you install Arcra.</p>

<p>If neither of these things are a deal breaker for you, then feel free to download my distro from the homepage.</p>
